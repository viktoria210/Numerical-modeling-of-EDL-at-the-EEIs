# Numerical-modeling-of-EDL-at-the-EEIs
The repository represents the results of numerical modeling of Electric Double Layers (EDL) at the Electrode-Electrolyte Interfaces (EEIs).
It was performed in Python within within the framework of The self-consistent field equations (SCF equations), taking into account structural interactions by adding the product of local concentration gradients multiplied by phenomenological structural constants. Electrostatic interaction with the pore walls was also taken into account due to the external electrostatic potential.

At the link above you can find the python code for solving the SCF system, as well as examples of calculations in dependace from the number of SCF system parameters.
